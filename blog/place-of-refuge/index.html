        <p>The Adullam Mission House is established as a ministry providing refuge for those overwhelmed by the hurt and pain surrounding them. When David sought shelter in the cave while fleeing from Saul, he experienced a complex range of emotions—fear, sadness, and likely anger. Although he was called to be king (1 Samuel 16:1), in that moment, it was difficult for him to see how it could come to pass as he was running for his life (1 Samuel 22:1-2).</p>

        <blockquote>
            "The Lord said to Samuel, 'How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.'" — 1 Samuel 16:1
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father's household heard it, they went down there to him. And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, gathered to him. And he became commander over them. And there were with him about four hundred men." — 1 Samuel 22:1-2
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Seeking the Lord in the Cave</h2>

        <p>In the cave of Adullam, David sought the Lord (Psalm 57:1). If it had been possible to witness those moments, one would observe how David cried out about his circumstances while maintaining his love and reverence for God (Psalm 142). By the time David and those who accompanied him emerged from the refuge of the caves, he had been transformed—not only through a personal revival with the Lord but also by developing a deeper level of empathy that ultimately contributed to his effectiveness as king (Psalm 18:1-3).</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the storms of destruction pass by." — Psalm 57:1
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "I cry out to the Lord with my voice; With my voice to the Lord I make my supplication. I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare before Him my trouble." — Psalm 142:1-2
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "I love you, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. I call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies." — Psalm 18:1-3
        </blockquote>

        <h2>From Refuge to Purpose</h2>

        <p>David's retreat to the cave, his seeking of God, and his subsequent empowerment and revival prepared him to step into the purpose God had for him (2 Samuel 5:2).</p>

        <blockquote>
            "In times past, while Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the Lord said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.'" — 2 Samuel 5:2
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Our Foundational Goal</h2>

        <p>This is the foundational goal of the Adullam Mission House: to be a place where individuals may work through challenging times (Psalm 34:18), attend services designed to promote healing and restoration (Isaiah 40:31), and receive support to rise again and fulfill the divine purpose ordained for them (Jeremiah 29:11; Proverbs 3:5-6).</p>

        <blockquote>
            "The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit." — Psalm 34:18
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint." — Isaiah 40:31
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope." — Jeremiah 29:11
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths." — Proverbs 3:5-6
