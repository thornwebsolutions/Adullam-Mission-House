        <p>Grief doesn't follow a timeline. It doesn't progress neatly from stage to stage, checking boxes until we reach "acceptance." Instead, grief moves in seasons—sometimes predictable, often surprising, always deeply personal.</p>

        <h2>The Unpredictability of Grief</h2>
        <p>You might have days where you feel like you're finally turning a corner, only to be blindsided by a wave of sorrow triggered by a song, a smell, or an ordinary Tuesday afternoon. This isn't a setback—it's simply how grief works.</p>

        <p>Understanding that grief has seasons can help us extend grace to ourselves. Just as winter always gives way to spring, the harshest seasons of grief will eventually soften, even if they return from time to time.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven... a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance." — Ecclesiastes 3:1, 4
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Navigating Different Seasons</h2>
        <p>Some seasons of grief require us to simply survive—to get through each day, each hour, each moment. Other seasons invite us to begin the work of healing, to process our pain with trusted others, and to slowly rebuild our lives.</p>

        <p>There are also seasons of unexpected joy that can feel confusing or even guilt-inducing. It's okay to laugh again. It's okay to find moments of happiness. These don't diminish your love for what you've lost—they're signs that healing is happening.</p>

        <h2>Being Patient with Yourself</h2>
        <p>Whatever season you find yourself in today, be patient with yourself. Grief is not a problem to be solved but a journey to be walked. There is no "right" way to grieve, and there is no deadline by which you must be "over it."</p>

        <p>At Adullam Mission House, we meet people in every season of grief. We don't rush the process or impose expectations. We simply walk alongside, offering support, understanding, and the reminder that every season eventually changes.</p>
