        <p>Your deepest wounds can become your greatest ministry. This isn't just an inspirational saying—it's a biblical pattern we see throughout Scripture and in the lives of countless people who have walked through the doors of Adullam Mission House.</p>

        <h2>The Redemption of Suffering</h2>
        <p>God doesn't waste our pain. While He doesn't cause our suffering, He is masterful at redeeming it—at taking the broken pieces of our lives and creating something beautiful, meaningful, and useful.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose." — Romans 8:28
        </blockquote>

        <p>Joseph was betrayed by his brothers, sold into slavery, and wrongfully imprisoned. Yet from that place of pain, he rose to a position where he could save nations—including the very family that had wronged him. His pain became his platform.</p>

        <h2>Comfort That Multiplies</h2>
        <p>One of the most profound ways our pain transforms into purpose is through our ability to comfort others with the comfort we ourselves have received. No one understands the grief of losing a child like someone who has walked that path. No one can speak into addiction recovery quite like someone who has experienced freedom.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God." — 2 Corinthians 1:3-4
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Your Story Matters</h2>
        <p>Your story—including its darkest chapters—matters. It may be the very thing that gives someone else hope. It may be the bridge that helps another person believe that healing is possible.</p>

        <p>At Adullam Mission House, we believe that everyone who comes through our doors has the potential not just to be healed, but to become a healer. When you're ready, your pain can become a powerful testimony of God's faithfulness and redemption.</p>
