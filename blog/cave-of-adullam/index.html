        <p>The name "Adullam Mission House" isn't arbitrary—it's deeply rooted in a powerful biblical narrative that speaks to the very heart of our mission. Understanding the story of the cave of Adullam helps illuminate why we do what we do and who we exist to serve.</p>

        <h2>The Biblical Story</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him. And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, gathered to him. And he became commander over them." — 1 Samuel 22:1-2
        </blockquote>

        <p>David was running for his life. The king wanted him dead, and he had nowhere to turn. He fled to a cave in the wilderness—a place of hiding, of survival. But something remarkable happened in that cave.</p>

        <h2>A Gathering of the Broken</h2>
        <p>Word spread that David was in Adullam, and those who were distressed, in debt, and bitter in soul began to gather around him. These weren't the elite, the successful, or the put-together. These were the broken, the marginalized, the desperate.</p>

        <p>In the cave of Adullam, they found refuge. They found community with others who understood their struggle. And under David's leadership, they were transformed from a ragtag group of outcasts into mighty warriors—the very men who would later help establish David's kingdom.</p>

        <h2>Our Modern Adullam</h2>
        <p>Adullam Mission House exists to be a modern-day cave of Adullam. We open our doors to those who are distressed, those who feel the weight of life's debts—whether financial, emotional, or spiritual—and those whose souls have become bitter from pain and disappointment.</p>

        <p>Like David's cave, we offer refuge. But refuge is just the beginning. Our mission is not only to shelter the broken but to see them restored and launched into their God-given purpose. Just as those desperate men became David's mighty warriors, we believe that those who come to us broken will be transformed into people of strength, purpose, and impact.</p>

        <h2>Your Invitation</h2>
        <p>If you identify with those who gathered at Adullam—if you are distressed, burdened, or bitter in soul—know that there is a place for you here. You are not defined by your current circumstances. Your story is still being written, and God specializes in turning caves of desperation into launching pads for destiny.</p>
