        <p>We were never meant to walk through our darkest moments alone. From the very beginning, God designed us for community—for connection, support, and shared experience. When David fled to the cave of Adullam, he didn't find healing in isolation. Instead, those who were distressed, in debt, and discontented gathered around him, and together they became something greater than they could have been alone.</p>

        <h2>The Isolation of Grief</h2>
        <p>One of the most insidious effects of grief and brokenness is the tendency to withdraw. We convince ourselves that our pain is too heavy for others to carry, that we'll be a burden, or that no one could possibly understand what we're going through.</p>

        <p>But isolation only deepens our wounds. When we cut ourselves off from others, we lose access to the very resources God has provided for our healing—the listening ear, the understanding heart, the shared tears, and the gentle reminder that we are not alone.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up." — Ecclesiastes 4:9-10
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Healing Power of Being Known</h2>
        <p>There is profound healing in being truly known—in having someone witness your pain without trying to fix it, in sharing your story with those who respond with compassion rather than judgment. At Adullam Mission House, we've seen how powerful it is when someone realizes they're not the only one struggling.</p>

        <p>Support groups, shared meals, and intentional community provide safe spaces where masks can come off and authentic connection can happen. In these spaces, healing accelerates because we're no longer carrying our burdens alone.</p>

        <h2>Finding Your Community</h2>
        <p>If you're walking through a difficult season, we encourage you to resist the urge to isolate. Reach out to a trusted friend, join a support group, or connect with a faith community. The first step may feel uncomfortable, but the rewards of community far outweigh the vulnerability it requires.</p>

        <p>At Adullam Mission House, our doors are always open to those seeking refuge and community. You don't have to have it all together to belong here. Come as you are.</p>
